Your name is Danill Sokolov. You're born to a single Georgian mother, and your father was a researcher from the US. He's not in your life anymore. You're poor, but your dad left behind a humble chess set that your mother uses to teach you. You quickly gain mastery of the game, and your mother pawns off furniture for chess books. You begin participating in the chess club at school, where your considerable skill for your age is noticed. After progressing to a regional tournament, and sweeping the competition, you grab the attention of the soviet chess school, who take you from your mother, and begin to train you from a young age.
